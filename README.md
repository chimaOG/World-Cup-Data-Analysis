# World-Cup-Data-Analysis:
Analyze and visualize data of all the world cups from 1930 to 2014.

#Libraries Used: 
Pandas & Matplotlib

#Project Motivation: 
Football arguments tend to be more emotional than factual most of this time.
The goal of this project is to used data analysis to confirm specific facts about the world cup over its long history. 
The visualisations created using the code in this project were deigned to answer the following questions:
1) Which country and continent are the most successful at the world cup?
2) Which countries can be considered world cup elite teams?
3) Have the number of goals per match increased over time?

#Files Used
1) The first file is a torunament level data that gives details about the tournaments. Some columns in this data set include the number of qualified teams, number of goals scored and eventual winner.

2) The second file offers us more granular data at the individual match level that gives details about the specific matches. Some columns in this data set include the teams, number of goals scored and eventual winner of each match.

Both files were obtained from the FIFA world cup archives and are available in this repo.
